/proc : 
    files of the processes, there are sub-directories for every PID

ps : ps [options]
    PID : Process ID
    TTY : Controlling terminal associated with the process
    TIME : Total CPU usage time
    CMD : Name of executable/command
    a : all processes running, including the ones being ran by other users
    u : displays all processes running, including the ones being ran by other users. The u shows more
        USER : The effective user (the one whose access we are using)
        PID : Process ID
        %CPU : CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running
        %MEM : Ratio of the process's resident set size to the physical memory on the machine
        VSZ : Virtual memory usage of the entire process
        RSS : Resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used
        TTY : Controlling terminal associated with the process
        STAT : Process status code
        START : Start time of the process
        TIME : Total CPU usage time
        COMMAND : Name of executable/command
    x : all processes that don't have a TTY associated with it

top : top
    give process info realtime
    NI column, that is the niceness level of a process, number to determine their priority for the CPU. high number means lower priority for the CPU low or negative number wants to get as much of the CPU as possible
    nice : nice -n 5 apt upgrade -> nice command is used to set priority for a new process
    renice : renice 10 -p 3245 -> renice command is used to set priority on an existing process

kill : kill [code] [Process ID]
    SIGHUP or HUP or 1 : Hangup, sent to a process when the controlling terminal is closed. For example, if you closed a terminal window that had a process running in it, you would get a SIGHUP signal. So basically you've been hung up on
    SIGINT or INT or 2 : Is an interrupt signal, so you can use Ctrl-C and the system will try to gracefully kill the process
    SIGKILL or KILL or 9 : Kill the process, kill it with fire, doesn't do any cleanup
    SIGTERM or TERM or 15 : Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup first
    SIGSTOP or STOP : Stop/suspend a process
