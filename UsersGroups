The system uses a user ID (UID) to identify a user. To find out what users are mapped to what ID, look at the /etc/passwd file.
    /etc/passwd : shows a list of users and detailed information about them
        root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
            root : username
            x : encrypted user passwords, "*" means the user doesn't have login access & blank field that means the user doesn't have a password.
            0 : The user ID
            0 : The group ID
            root : GECOS field - This is used to generally leave comments about the user or account such as their real name or phone number, it is comma delimited.
            /root : User's home directory
            /bin/bash : User's shell

    /etc/shadow : used to store information about user authentication
        root:MyEPTEa$6Nonsense:15000:0:99999:7:::
            root : Username
            MyEPTEa$6Nonsense : Encrypted password
            15000 : Date of last password changed - expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970. If there is a 0 that means the user should change their password the next time they login
            0 : Days that a user will have to wait before being able to change their password again
            99999 : Maximum number of days before a user has to change their password
            7 : Number of days before a password is going to expire
              : Number of days after a password has expired to allow login with their password
              : date that user will not be able to login
              : Reserved field for future use

    /etc/group
        root:*:0:pete
            root : Group name
            * : Group password - there isn't a need to set a group password, using an elevated privilege like sudo is standard. A "*" will be put in place as the default value.
            0 : Group ID (GID)
            pete : List of users - you can manually specify users you want in a specific group

useradd & userdel vs userdel & deluser
Level:

useradd: Low-level system tool.
adduser: High-level, user-friendly script.
Interactive:

useradd: No, non-interactive by default.
adduser: Yes, asks questions during setup.
Home Directory Creation:

useradd: Does not create a home directory unless the -m option is used.
adduser: Automatically creates a home directory by default.
Password Setup:

useradd: Requires a separate passwd command to set the password.
adduser: Prompts for a password interactively during user creation.
Default Configurations:

useradd: Minimal defaults, requires options for most configurations.
adduser: Uses sensible defaults, automating much of the setup.
Flexibility and Customization:

useradd: Highly flexible, allowing customization for UID, GID, shell, etc.
adduser: Simplified, but offers less customization.
Use Case:

useradd: Best for advanced use, scripting, or manual configurations.
adduser: Best for everyday use, convenient for quick user creation.
