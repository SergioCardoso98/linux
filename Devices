devices info is in the
    /dev : /dev directory is simple, it allows other programs to access devices themselves
    /sys : is used to view information and manage the device, contains all the information for all devices on your system, such as the manufacturer and model, where the device is plugged in, the state of the device, the hierarchy of devices and more

type
    c : character
        These devices transfer data, but one a character at a time
    b - block
        These devices transfer data, but in large fixed-sized blocks. devices that utilize data blocks as block devices, such as harddrives, filesystems, etc.
    p - pipe
        Named pipes allow two or more processes to communicate with each other, these are similar to character devices, but instead of having output sent to a device, it's sent to another process.
    s - socket
        Socket devices facilitate communication between processes, similar to pipe devices but they can communicate with many processes at once.
